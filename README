svn-merge-tools
===============

Several helper scripts for performing merges and also to identify the commits of interest.

Script Index:

* view-conflict.sh
	This provides a way to view the conflicts (both tree and file) and to delegate to kdiff3 for resolving file conflicts.

* git/compare-revs.sh

	This needs to be run in a git repository that mirrors the svn repo and includes the commit meta data (the git-svn-id lines that include the svn revision of the commit.


	

view-conflict.sh
-----------------

The view-conflict.sh shell script depends on the kdiff3 program being in the path.


http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/

This exists for both linux and Windows.

If running in Windows the program will work in a recent Mingw32 installation:
http://www.mingw.org

USAGE: <mode: SHOW|VIEW|RESOLVE>

SHOW:

show the file conflicts and then the tree conflicts

VIEW:

show the first file conflict in a kdiff3 merge tool window.

A panel is original, B panel is the inbound change, lower panel is the working copy.


RESOLVE:

with no arguments will resolve the first file conflict with 

svn resolve --accept working path/to/file

with the TREE argument will resolve the tree conflict.

git/compare-revs.sh
-------------------


	SHOW <changes in branch> <since branch> [gitk]

	Show the commits in the first branch/commitish specified since the point given.  

	optionally display the results in gitk.

	BY_JIRA <changes in branch> <since branch> [show_headers]

	Determines the git commits and then for each of them parses the commit message to extract the revision.

	This can be used to quickly identify the svn revisions for each jira which is useful when we want to exclude or include commits based on a particular jira number.

apply-merge.sh
--------------

	<source repo URL> <revision(s) to cherry-pick>

	to pass multiple revisions they need to be wrapped in a quoted string like: "123 456 789" to cherry pick revs: 123, 456 and 789 from the source repo URL
