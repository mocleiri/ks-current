Helper tools for syncing between the rewritten repository and source repository.

The script will fetch the changes between max revision of target repo and HEAD revision of the source repo.

Then in another mode you can apply the changes into the target repo.

If there is a problem you will have to clear the lock before proceeding.

svn propdel --revprop -r0 svn:rdump-lock file:///absolute/path/to/target/repo

The fetch and apply scripts will have to be customized for your local repository locations.
