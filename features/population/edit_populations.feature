Feature: EC.Edit populations

In order to reserve seats in a course offering for a group of students 
I want to create populations and in order to effectively manage populations
I want to be able to edit them.

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a Schedule Coordinator

  Scenario: Successfully edit a rule based population
    When I create a population that is rule-based
    And I update all the editable fields of the population
    Then a read-only view of the updated population is displayed

  Scenario: Successfully edit a population based on a Union operation
    When I create a population that is union-based
    And I update all the editable fields of the population
    Then a read-only view of the updated population is displayed

  Scenario: Successfully edit a population based on an Exclusion operation
    When I create a population that is exclusion-based
    And I update all the editable fields of the population
    Then a read-only view of the updated population is displayed

  Scenario: Successfully edit a population that uses Intersection
    When I create a population that is intersection-based
    And I update all the editable fields of the population
    Then a read-only view of the updated population is displayed

  Scenario: Attempt to edit a population using a name that has already been associated with a population
    When I rename a population with an existing name
    Then an error message appears stating "Please enter a different, unique population name"
    And the population name is not changed

  Scenario: Attempt to edit the operation type for populations defined by using other populations
    When I am editing a union-based population
    Then the population operation type is read-only
