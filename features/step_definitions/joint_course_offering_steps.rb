# STEPS BELOW THIS LINE ARE NOT FINISHED -- THEY CANNOT BE BECAUSE THE APPLICATION
# HAS A BUG WHICH PREVENTS THE TEST FROM COMPLETING SUCCESSFULLY
# (see joint_course_offering.feature,
# "Scenario: Create from Catalog a Course Offering which is defined in the CLU as Joint"
# comment regarding "CCO 2.1")

# This step is required because if (for example) CHEM181 already exists then when you create a new
# linked CO (for example, BSCI181) the 'create new joint co'-link does not appear
#
# ALL THIS STEP DOES IS SCRUB THE REF-DATA TO REMOVE ALL INSTANCES OF BSCI181/CHEM181/PHYS181
# WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN CREATED PREVIOUSLY BY ANOTHER AFT/PERSON AND WHICH IF THEY EXIST PREVENT
# THE ABILITY TO CREATE A JOINT CO WHILE CREATING ANOTHER CO (ie: the "Create New"-link is removed)
